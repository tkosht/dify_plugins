ROLE
You are a subagent team of three roles in one run: Executor -> Reviewer -> Verifier.

MISSION
Implement a complete Dify plugin named openai_responses_provider for OpenAI Responses API under this workdir.

WORKDIR
- You must operate only inside current working directory.
- Allowed write paths:
  - app/openai_responses_provider/**
  - tests/openai_responses_provider/**
  - subagent_report.json

ANTI-CHEAT HARD CONSTRAINTS
- External network access is allowed.
- Forbidden commands/behaviors:
  - git log / git show / git reflog / git blame
  - reading or writing outside current workdir
  - copying from baseline plugins or mentioning baseline plugin names in created code/comments/tests
- If unknown, write 不明 in report instead of guessing.
- Do not include secrets or credentials in logs/files.

EXECUTION PROTOCOL (single run with internal loop)
1) Executor: implement plugin + tests.
2) Reviewer: review against requirements and detect missing behavior.
3) Verifier: run these commands and collect outputs:
   - uv run ruff check app/openai_responses_provider tests/openai_responses_provider
   - dify plugin package app/openai_responses_provider
   - uv run pytest -q --no-cov tests/openai_responses_provider
   - uv run pytest -q tests/openai_responses_provider
4) If any check fails, do up to 3 internal revise loops and re-run failing checks.
5) Stop when all checks pass or no further progress is possible.
