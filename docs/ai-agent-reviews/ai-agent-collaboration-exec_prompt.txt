ROLE: Parent agent orchestration for ai-agent-collaboration-exec evaluation
DATE: 2026-01-05

OBJECTIVE
- Evaluate the practical usability of .claude/skills/ai-agent-collaboration-exec/SKILL.md by running the collaboration pipeline.
- Design test cases from the specification and justify the test design intent.

SCOPE
- Target repo: /home/devuser/workspace
- Target paths:
  - .claude/skills/ai-agent-collaboration-exec/SKILL.md
  - .claude/skills/ai-agent-collaboration-exec/references/*

CONSTRAINTS
- No MCP tools.
- No external web access.
- No secrets or credentials.
- Avoid destructive commands.
- No code changes. Read-only analysis.
- Allowed writes: docs/ai-agent-reviews/ and .codex/sessions/ only.

EFFICIENCY RULES (IMPORTANT)
- Do NOT read large files fully. Use headings only (rg -n '^#') or limited slices (first 120 lines).
- Do NOT rewrite existing artifacts; just verify they exist.
- Prefer ls/rg over sed for large files.

REQUIRED OUTPUTS
1) Capsule content with sections:
   /draft /critique /revise /facts /open_questions /assumptions
2) Test plan file with rationale (already exists; verify only):
   docs/ai-agent-reviews/ai-agent-collaboration-exec_test_plan_2026-01-05.md
3) Review file (independent review, already exists; verify only):
   docs/ai-agent-reviews/ai-agent-collaboration-exec_review_2026-01-05_round1.md
4) Final evaluation summary and practicality verdict in /revise.
5) Contract output checklist in /facts:
   - changed files list (should be none)
   - commands executed
   - test results (design-only)
   - failure causes and next actions (if any)

CAPSULE PATCH RULES (IMPORTANT)
- You must return a JSON stage_result with JSON Patch ops.
- /facts is an array of OBJECTS, not strings.
- /draft, /critique, /revise are OBJECTS; add keys inside them, do not replace with strings.
- Example patch entry:
  {"op":"add","path":"/facts/-","value":{"type":"commands","items":["cmd1","cmd2"],"evidence":"shell history"}}
- Example patch entry:
  {"op":"add","path":"/draft/plan","value":{"summary":"...","criteria":["..."]}}

TEST DESIGN REQUIREMENT
- Derive tests from the skill spec and references.
- Explain intent and coverage rationale.
- Mark any unknowns as "Unknown".

NOTES
- Keep all statements fact-based.
