ROLE: Parent agent orchestration for ai-agent-collaboration-exec evaluation
DATE: 2026-01-08

OBJECTIVE
- Evaluate the practical usability of .claude/skills/ai-agent-collaboration-exec/SKILL.md by running the collaboration pipeline.
- Execute all phases (draft/execute/review/revise/verify) at full quality; do not skip tasks.

SCOPE
- Target repo: /home/devuser/workspace
- Target paths:
  - .claude/skills/ai-agent-collaboration-exec/SKILL.md
  - .claude/skills/ai-agent-collaboration-exec/references/*

CONSTRAINTS
- No MCP tools.
- No external web access.
- No secrets or credentials.
- Avoid destructive commands.
- Allowed writes: docs/ai-agent-reviews/ and .codex/sessions/ only.

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
- Do NOT reduce quality or omit steps.
- If output is long, write it to files under docs/ai-agent-reviews and only summarize in the capsule.
- Keep /facts minimal: include only file paths and key verification points (avoid large command lists).

REQUIRED OUTPUTS (FULL QUALITY)
1) Capsule content with sections:
   /draft /critique /revise /facts /open_questions /assumptions
2) Test plan file with rationale:
   docs/ai-agent-reviews/ai-agent-collaboration-exec_test_plan_2026-01-05.md
3) Review file (independent review):
   docs/ai-agent-reviews/ai-agent-collaboration-exec_review_2026-01-05_round1.md

7) Final evaluation summary and practicality verdict in /revise.

CAPSULE PATCH RULES (IMPORTANT)
- Return JSON stage_result with JSON Patch ops only.
- /facts is an array of OBJECTS, not strings.

  {"op":"add","path":"/facts/-","value":{"type":"artifacts","items":["docs/ai-agent-reviews/..."],"evidence":"file exists"}}

TEST DESIGN REQUIREMENT
- Derive tests from the skill spec and references.
- Explain intent and coverage rationale.
- Mark any unknowns as "Unknown".

NOTES
