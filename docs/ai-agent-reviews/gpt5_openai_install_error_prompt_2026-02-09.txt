ROLE: Parent agent orchestration for Plugin A install decode error analysis
DATE: 2026-02-09

STRICT NO-TOOLS RULE
- Do NOT call any tools or run commands.
- Use ONLY FACTS INPUT below.
- If evidence is insufficient, mark as 不明.
- Output JSON ONLY (single-line JSON; no extra text).

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)
- Required keys: schema_version, stage_id, status, output_is_partial, capsule_patch.
- Do NOT include next_stages.
- /facts is an array of objects; each object includes item, evidence, source, status.
- /draft /critique /revise must be objects.
- /open_questions and /assumptions must be arrays.
- All string values must be single-line and must not contain newline or \\n.

OBJECTIVE
- Analyze root causes for Plugin A install error:
  Failed to parse response from plugin daemon to PluginDaemonBasicResponse [PluginDecodeResponse]
  at URL plugin/<workspace>/management/install/upload/package

SCOPE
- Target plugin: openai_gpt5_responses
- Target artifact: plugins/openai_gpt5_responses.difypkg
- Target files: app/openai_gpt5_responses/* and tests/openai_gpt5_responses/*

CONSTRAINTS
- Fact-based reasoning only.
- No speculation without evidence.
- Keep plugin A analysis independent from plugin B.

REQUIRED OUTPUTS
1) Root causes ranked (high/medium/low confidence).
2) Supporting evidence and refuting evidence per cause.
3) Minimal mitigation plan.
4) Unknowns that still require server logs.

CAPSULE PATCH RULES
- /facts must be an array of objects with item, evidence, source, status.
- /draft /critique /revise must be objects.
- /open_questions and /assumptions must be arrays.
- capsule_patch should contain only one operation.

PIPELINE DESIGN REQUIREMENT
- Do not follow generic template blindly.
- In /draft.proposal, include why draft->execute->review is enough.

TEST DESIGN REQUIREMENT
- Include verification commands relevant to this plugin package:
  - dify plugin package
  - dify plugin module list
  - pytest target scope

FACTS INPUT (EVIDENCE ONLY)
- [error] install request failed with PluginDecodeResponse at upload/package endpoint (user report).
- [build] /home/devuser/workspace/plugins/openai_gpt5_responses.difypkg exists and is regenerated on 2026-02-09 18:16 JST.
- [module-list] dify plugin module list plugins/openai_gpt5_responses.difypkg succeeds and lists models/parameters.
- [yaml] app/openai_gpt5_responses/models/llm/gpt-5-codex.yaml:18-20 has help.en_US/help.ja_JP; same schema style applied across gpt-5*.yaml.
- [package-contents] plugins/openai_gpt5_responses.difypkg contains __pycache__/*.pyc entries:
  __pycache__/main.cpython-312.pyc, internal/__pycache__/*.pyc, models/llm/__pycache__/llm.cpython-312.pyc, provider/__pycache__/openai_gpt5.cpython-312.pyc.
- [runtime-import-style] app/openai_gpt5_responses/models/llm/llm.py uses app.* import with fallback to internal.* (try/except ModuleNotFoundError).
- [runtime-import-style] app/openai_gpt5_responses/provider/openai_gpt5.py uses app.* import with fallback to internal.*.
